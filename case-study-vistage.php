                <div class="sep-grey-125"></div>
                <p>The relationship kicked off with a small development team, but grew rapidly as the Vistage IT Department began to request additional support across different projects and technologies. We have used a team augmentation approach that has enabled us to satisfy peaks in demand in no more than a couple of weeks while constantly increasing our pool of developers in terms of quantity, level of expertise and technology diversity. Today, we have assembled the following teams to collaborate on various projects for Vistage:</p>

                    <p>Providing service at your customer’s premises can be a challenging feat. It requires coordinating travel logistics while sensitively managing expectations and performance when both teams meet at the same location. In this type of situation, there can be inherent risk factors that could detract from excellence.</p>

                    <p>We understand that being a great partner means providing solutions when, where and how your customer needs it. This principal is why we relocated part of the quality assurance team from Córdoba to Vistage’s premises on a full time basis in San Diego.</p>

                <div class="sep-grey-125"></div>
                <p>Just like people, companies also have personalities. It is what it is known as business culture. Business culture plays an important role to retain people within an organization, but it is also fundamental to establishing long-term partnerships. Apart from sharing the same time zone, Santex and Vistage also share a set of organizational values that has enabled this relationship to reach new heights over the years.</p>
