                <p>Valued at $3.65 trillion, the US healthcare industry is larger than many national economies.
                    Disrupting this giant with new technology is not an easy task, even for the most cutting edge,
                    forward-thinking companies.<br><b>Yet CareCloud is attempting to do so.</b></p>
                <p>They believe healthcare deserves tools that are as modern, well-designed, and easy-to-use as the ones

                <div class="sep-grey-125"></div>
                <p>Like many companies in the US, CareCloud was resource-constrained in terms of senior developers, a
                    scarce resource which often prevents businesses from moving faster.</p>
                <p>The shortage was disproportionately large in terms of native mobile devs, which CareCloud needed for
                    Breeze and Go, two of their main projects. </p>
                <p><b>CareCloud Go is a revolutionary platform that unifies all clinical, financial, administrative and
                        patient experience data in one seamless system.</b></p>

                <p>According to CareCloud, the recruitment process and ramp-up period for new candidates had become a
                    pain point. It required a lengthy, time-involved process to evaluate and decide between various
                    applicants in addition to the legal and financial arrangements necessary to onboard a new hire. The
                    entire process, in some cases, could require up to 4 months to fill one position.</p>
                <p><b class="black">At the time CareCloud reached out to us, recruiting and scaling their in-house
                        development teams had become costly and time-consuming.</b></p>

                <div class="sep-grey-125"></div>
                <p>CareCloud previously had a negative experience with a former software partner, but they decided to
                    give offshoring another chance when a trusted colleague recommended Santex. We knew it would prove
                    to be challenging, but we do not shy away from any opportunities to improve and gladly accepted the
                    road ahead. From that very moment, the ability to find the right solution was in our hands.</p>
                <p>Our human capital department worked around the clock to assemble a team of senior software
                    developers, mobile application developers, business analysts and quality assurance engineers with
                    relevant experience in the <b>life science industry.</b></p>

                <p>Initially our work with CareCloud began around mobile development, and from there continued to grow
                    consistently in terms of volume and diversity of tasks. Time and time again we were trusted with new
                    projects thanks to our exceptional retention rates, our capacity for working well together and our
                    aptitude for solving complex issues quickly.</p>

                <p>During the first phase, we elaborated a refactoring plan to boost the application’s performance. We
                    started by cleaning up the existing code to keep it concise and succinct to ensure readability. Then
                    we decided to implement peer reviews whenever a team member opened a pull request for new code and
                    branching model management for prioritizing features.</p>
                <p>We also integrated code analysis tools such as Codeclimate and used a continuous integration service
                    (Travis). Finally, we systematized the testing of new features by adding continuous delivery with
                    HockeyApp (now App Center) and generating UI automation tests that allowed us to have automatic
                    regression testing for each new feature.</p>

                <p>The second phase involved converting teams to agile methodologies and supporting CareCloud with local
                    Scrum Masters. They carried out an agile assessment and identified three areas for improvement:</p>
                <ul class="check">
                    <li>Developing cross-functional teams in order to remove dependencies and allow each group to work
                        at their own pace, in order to deliver end-to-end features.</li>
                    <li>Defining working agreements between teams to help establish a list of metrics so that management
                        could have clear insights into the development efforts.</li>
                    <li>Supporting teams with specific agile training to help incorporate an agile mindset grounded in
                        delivering value to end-users.</li>

                    That is why this phase of our relationship has revolved around the implementation of DevOps: We
                    have optimized infrastructure, stabilized developing environments and documented processes in
